## Lessons Learned

What did you learn while building this project? 

1. Experimenting with GSAP’s Advanced Features:

Besides basic animations, I explored GSAP's advanced features like ScrollTrigger and Timeline. Using timelines allowed me to sequence animations in a more controlled manner, achieving complex effects that added depth to the page without overloading it.

2. Writing Clean, Scalable Code:

I focused on writing clean, modular code that could easily be maintained and scaled if new features are added. This included creating reusable classes in CSS and writing self-contained JavaScript functions. Clean code helps make future modifications easier and enhances collaboration with other developers.

3. Project Structure and File Organization:

Organizing project files was crucial for maintaining clarity as the project grew. I kept my CSS, JavaScript, and image assets in separate folders, making it easier to locate and modify files. This structure is helpful for future updates and collaboration.

4. Advanced CSS Techniques:

Gradient and Shadows: I explored gradient backgrounds and shadows to create depth, making elements stand out. These small touches helped improve the design’s modern and immersive feel.
Custom Fonts and Icons: I experimented with custom fonts and icon libraries, learning how to import and use them effectively to add personality to the page. The right typography and icons can drastically improve the UI’s look and feel.

5. GSAP for Animations:

I explored GSAP’s ScrollTrigger plugin to create smooth, engaging animations triggered by scrolling. Understanding GSAP’s syntax and methods was a bit challenging initially, but experimenting with different properties like stagger, duration, and ease made the animations more refined.
Animations improved the UX significantly, adding life to the landing page.

6. JavaScript for Interactivity:

JavaScript was essential for interactive components like buttons and scroll-triggered effects. It was interesting to combine event listeners with CSS transitions to create hover effects and dynamic content loading.
